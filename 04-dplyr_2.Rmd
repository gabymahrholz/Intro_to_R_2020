This lesson is led by [Jaimie Torrance](https://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/otherstaff/?id=TJ001).



##	Pre-Steps

1. Make sure to download todays materials and save them to your desired working directory. Make sure you have all the correct files including the `L4_Stub` file, and the data files; `CareerStats2.csv`, `wos_seasonal_sun.csv`, `wos_seasonal_rain.csv`, `wos_monthly_sun.csv` and `wos_monthly_rain.csv`.
2. Open the `L4_stub` file.
3. Load `tidyverse` into the library.
4. Read the data from `CareerStats2.csv` into your `Global Environment` as `MMA_Data`.


`r hide("Solution")`
```{r L4, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
MMA_Data <- read_csv("CareerStats2.csv")
```
`r unhide()`


## Practicing the Wikham Six

The first part of todays class will be practicing the Wickham Six some more, as was mentioned before, the vast majority of your "data time" will be wrangling your data, and most of that can be done with these six functions, so it's good to practice with them. First you'll see an example of each function to refresh your memory. Then you will be asked to try for yourself, these will be a little more involved than last week to really test you. If you are stuggling you can check the solutions, but try yourself first, and answer the questions too, this will help you check your code is correct.


### select()

First up lets try to narrow down this big data set, by taking `MMA_Data`, and selecting only the variables; `ID`, `Height`, `Weight`, `BMI`, `Reach` and `Stance`. We will store this in `Example_1`.

```{r}
Example_1 <- select(MMA_Data, ID, Height, Weight:Reach, Stance)
Example_1
```

```{block, type="info"}
Notice, this could also have been written as follows;
`Example_1 <- select(MMA_Data, ID, Height, Weight, BMI, Reach, Stance)`

We can use the `:` operator to sequence together columns that are next to each other in the original dataframe, this can save time but it is not necessary.
```


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Using `select()` keep everything from `Example_1` but except `Reach`, and store this in an object names `Q1`.

```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solutions
Q1 <- select(Example_1, -Reach)
#OR
Q1 <- select(Example_1, ID, Height, Weight, BMI, Stance)
```
`r unhide()`


### arrange()

Lets move on to `arrange()`; lets take the table `Example_1`, and arrange it first by `Weight`, then by `BMI`, we'll store this in `Example_2`.

```{r}
Example_2 <- arrange(Example_1, Weight, BMI)
Example_2
```

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

What is the height of the top entry in `Example_2`? `r fitb("69")`

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Using `arrange()`, take the table `Example_1` and arrange it first by `Reach` in *desceding* order, then by `Height` in *ascending* order. Store the result in `Q2`.

```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q2 <- arrange(Example_1, desc(Reach), desc(Height))
```
`r unhide()`


What is the `BMI` of the top entry in `Q2`? `r fitb("27.042")`



### filter()

Now onto `filter()` which has so many uses! Lets filter out all the athletes who are *over* 31 years of age
```{r}
Example_3 <- filter(MMA_Data, Age <=31)
Example_3
```


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

How many athletes (observations) are left in `Example_3`? `r fitb("97")`


```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Using `filter()`, take the original table `MMA_Data` and keep only those athletes in the 'Flyweight' and 'Lightweight' `WeightClasses` Store the result in `Q3`.

```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q3 <- filter(MMA_Data, WeightClass %in% c("Flyweight", "Lightweight"))
```
`r unhide()`

How many athletes (observations) are left in `Q3`? `r fitb("50")`



```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Now try taking the original table `MMA_Data` and keep only those athletes from the "Welterweight" `WeightClass`, who are over 72 inches in `Height`. Store the result in `Q4`.
- Hint - remember they will need to match *both* conditions 
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q4 <- filter(MMA_Data, WeightClass == "Welterweight", Height <= 72)
```
`r unhide()`


How many athletes (observations) are left in `Q4`? `r fitb("18")`

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Now try taking the original table `MMA_Data` and keep only those athletes who have the "Orthodox" `Stance` *AND* have 27 or more total fights (`T_Fights`) *OR* 15 or more wins by submission (`W_by_Sub`). Store the result in `Q5`.
- Hint - No matter what they need to have the `Orthodox` stance, regardless of the other conditions 
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q5 <- filter(MMA_Data, Stance == "Orthodox" & (T_Fights >= 27 | W_by_Sub >= 15))
#OR
Q5 <- filter(MMA_Data, Stance == "Orthodox", (T_Fights >= 27 | W_by_Sub >= 15))
```
`r unhide()`

`r hide("Explain This Answer")`
```{block, type="solved"}
There is essentially 2 parts to this question; the first criteria is to find athletes who have the "orthodox" stance... that's the first requirement... then *if* they matched that criteria, we want to check, if they have *EITHER* 27 or more total fights *OR* 15 or more wins by submission, which is why we need to put the second "either/or" criteria in brackets, so R knows to treat them together.

If you take the brackets out, it will treat the first two criteria as a joint criteria and the `|` "Or" operator creates the break. Meaning R thinks you are asking for; Athletes with the orthodox stance and 27 or more total fights... *OR* athletes with 15 or more wins by submission. Try running the code without the brackets and seeing what happens

`Q5Alt <- filter(MMA_Data, Stance == "Orthodox" & T_Fights >= 27 | W_by_Sub >= 15)`

Hopefully now you can understand the difference.

```
`r unhide()`

How many athletes (observations) are left in `Q5`? `r fitb("44")`





### mutate()

Moving on to mutate() now.

Lets add a new column onto the table `Example_1`, that shows `Reach` but in meters rather than inches, and we'll call it `ReachM`. We can make this column with `mutate()` by converting the inches value in the original `Reach` column into centimeters, by multiplying (`*`) the value by `2.54` and then dividing (`/`) the result by `100`.

```{r}
Example_4 <- mutate(Example_1, ReachM = (Reach*2.54)/100)
Example_4
```


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Take the table `Example_1` and mutate a new column onto it called `BMI_Alt`, this time attempting to recalculate BMI using the Weight and Height variables. The calculation for BMI is; weight in kilograms devided by height in meters squared. Lets break down the steps, you will need to;
- multiply `Weight` by 0.453 (to convert lbs to kgs)
- divide that by...
- `Height` multiplied 2.54 (to convert inches to cm), which you divide by 100 (to convert to m), which you then square
Store the result in `Q5`.

- Hint - the `^` symbol is for calculating "to the power of"
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q6 <- mutate(Example_1, BMI_Alt = (Weight*0.453)/(((Height*2.54)/100)^2))
```
`r unhide()`

```{block, type="info"}
Don't be worried if your new column is different by a few decimals (the original BMI was created with a slightly different calculation with different rounding). If they look approximately similar you have done it correctly.
```



### group_by() and summarise()

Now let's brush up on group_by and summarise().

Here we will take the original table `MMA_Data` and group that data by `WeightClass`.
Then we will create `mean()` summary stats for: 
Number of hits landed per minute (`TLpM`) and we'll call that column `MeanHit`, 
Number of hits absorbed per minute (`AbpM`) and we'll call that column `MeanAbsorb`, 
And average fight length (`Time_Avg`) and we'll call that column `MeanTime`.
```{r}
Example_5a <- group_by(MMA_Data, WeightClass)
Example_5b <- summarise(Example_5a, MeanHit = mean(TLpM), MeanAbsorb = mean(AbpM), MeanTime = mean(Time_Avg))
Example_5b
```

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

Which weightclass has the highest Hit average? `r fitb("LightHeavyweight")` <br>
Which weightclass has the lowest Absorbtion average? `r fitb("Flyweight")` <br>
Which weightclass has the highest average time? `r fitb("Flyweight")` <br>


```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Take the original table `MMA_Data` and group that data by `Stance` and `HeightClass` and store that in `Q7a`. 
Then create summary stats for success rate (`Success`), you should have columns called;
`MedSuccess` that shows the median success rate
`MaxSuccess` that shows the maximum success rate
`MinSuccess` that shows the minimum success rate
`SDSuccess` that shows the standard deviation of success rate
The resulting table should be stored in `Q7b`.
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q7a <- group_by(MMA_Data, Stance, HeightClass)
Q7b <- summarise(Q7a, MedSuccess = median(Success), MaxSuccess = max(Success), MinSuccess = min(Success), SDSuccess = sd(Success))
```
`r unhide()`


Which Stance/HeightClass combo has the highest median success rate? (enter your answers in the format Stance/HeightClass) `r fitb("Swithc/Tall")` <br>
What is the minimum success rate of tall athletes with an orthodox stance? `r fitb("0.415")` <br>
What is the standard deviation in success rate for short athletes with a southpaw stance? (write your answer to 3 decimal places) `r fitb("0.062")` <br>




### Bringing it all together 

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**
This is another multi-part question...

* Take the original table `MMA_Data`, and select just `ID`, `WeightClass`, `Stance`, `T_Wins`, `W_by_Decision`, `W_by_KO/TKO` and `W_by_Sub`. Store the result in `Q8a`.
* Take `Q8a` and filter out all the athletes with the "Southpaw" `Stance`. Store the result in Q8b.
* Take `Q8b` and mutate on a new column called `Perc_W_by_Dec` that shows the percentage of total wins (`T_Wins`) that are accounted for by decisions (`W_by_Decision`). Store the result in `Q8c`.
* Take `Q8c` and group that data by `WeightClass`. Store the result in `Q8d`.
* Take `Q8d` and create summary stats that show the mean of `Perc_W_by_Dec`. Store the result in `Q8e`.
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
# Jaimie's solution
Q8a <- select(MMA_Data, ID, WeightClass, Stance, T_Wins, W_by_Decision, "W_by_KO/TKO", W_by_Sub)
Q8b <- filter(Q8a, Stance != "Southpaw")
Q8c <- mutate(Q8b, Perc_W_by_Dec = (W_by_Decision/T_Wins)*100)
Q8d <- group_by(Q8c, WeightClass)
Q8e <- summarise(Q8d, AvgPercDec = mean(Perc_W_by_Dec))
```
`r unhide()`

Which weightclass has the lowest average percentage of wins by decision? `r fitb("Heavyweight")`



## The pipe operator (%>%) {#pipes}

As you may have noticed, your environment pane has become increasingly cluttered. Indeed, every time you introduced a new line of code, you created a uniquely-named object (unless your original object is overwritten). This can become confusing and time-consuming. One solution is the pipe operator (`%>%`) which aims to increase efficiency and improve the readability of your code. The pipe operator (`%>%`) read as **"and then"** allows you to chain functions together, eliminating the need to create intermediary objects. This creates a "pipeline", allowing the "flow" of data between lines of code, as the output of one function "flows" into the next function. There is no limit as to how many functions you can chain together in a single pipeline.

For example, in order to `filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarise()` the data, you would have used the following code lines:

```{r}
Example_6a <- filter(MMA_Data, ReachClass == "Above")
Example_6b <- group_by(Example_6a, WeightClass)
Example_6c <- summarise(Example_6b, MeanSub = mean(SubAtt_Avg))
Example_6c
```

However, utilisation of the pipe operator (`%>%`) can simplify this process and create only one object (`Example_7`) as shown:

```{r}
Example_7 <- MMA_Data %>%
  filter(ReachClass == "Above") %>%
  group_by(WeightClass) %>%
  summarise(MeanSub = mean(SubAtt_Avg))
Example_7
```

As you can see, `Example_7` produces the same output as `Example_6c`. So, pipes automatically take the output from one function and feed it directly to the next function. Without pipes, you needed to insert your chosen dataset as the first argument to every function. With pipes, you are only required to specify the original dataset (i.e  `MMA_Data`) once at the beginning of the pipeline, and removes the need to create unnecessary intermediary objects. You now no longer need the first argument of each of the subsequent functions anymore, because the pipe will know to look at the output from the previous step in the pipeline.


```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Amend all of your code from Question8 and turn it into a single pipeline
Save this as an object called `Q9` to your `Global Environment`.
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
#Jaimie's solution
Q9 <- MMA_Data %>%
  select(ID, WeightClass, Stance, T_Wins, W_by_Decision, "W_by_KO/TKO", W_by_Sub) %>%
  filter(Stance != "Southpaw") %>%
  mutate(Perc_W_by_Dec = (W_by_Decision/T_Wins)*100) %>%
  group_by(WeightClass) %>%
  summarise(AvgPercDec = mean(Perc_W_by_Dec))
Q9
```
`r unhide()`

If done correct `Q9` should look identical to `Q8e`


```{block, type="funfact"}

Note that in the above code chunk, the data object has been on its own line in the code followed immediately by `%>%` before starting with the "functions". 

The other option would have been to put the data object as the first argument within the first function. 

The benefit of having the data on its own is that you can reorder functions easily or squeeze another one in (for example if you summarised something but forgot to group beforehand) without the need to "move" the data object into the new first argument of the pipeline. 

```



## Two-Table Verbs

More often than not you will find yourself with data across multiple tables. In order to effectively combine multiple tables, `dplyr` provides a selection of **two-table verbs**. Today we will focus on two categories of two-table verbs - mutating join verbs and binding join verbs.



### Bringing in new data

First of all lets bring in some new data to look at these new functions.

#### What's the data

Source: Met Office National Climate Information Centre
https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-and-regional-series

wos_seasonal_sun: Seasonal total duration of bright sunshine for Scotland W; Areal series, starting in 1919

wos_monthly_sun: Monthly and annual total duration of bright sunshine for Scotland W; Areal series, starting in 1919

wos_seasonal_rain: Seasonal total precipitation amount for Scotland W; Areal series, starting in 1862

wos_monthly_rain: Monthly and annual total precipitation amount for Scotland W; Areal series, starting in 1862

```{r}
wos_seasonal_sun <- read_csv("wos_seasonal_sun.csv")

wos_monthly_sun <- read_csv("wos_monthly_sun.csv")

wos_seasonal_rain <- read_csv("wos_seasonal_rain.csv")

wos_monthly_rain <- read_csv("wos_monthly_rain.csv")
```


###	Mutating Join Verbs

Mutating join verbs combine the variables (columns) of two tables so that matching rows are together. There are 4 different types of mutating joins, namely `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`, and `full_join()`.

Mutating joins have the following basic syntax:

<center> <img src="images/join.png"> </center>

To help you visualise what these joining functions are doing, we will use some simple diagrams, like the one below. Here `data1` (shown below in blue) represents our "left" dataframe (or table) and `data2` (shown below in green) represents our "right" dataframe.

<center> <img src="images/join_tables.png" height="200"> </center>

To make things nice and clear to see, lets simplify our data a litte.

```{r}
Summer_Rain <- wos_seasonal_rain %>% 
  select(year, sum)

Summer_Sun <- wos_seasonal_sun %>% 
  select(year, sum)

Summer_Rain
Summer_Sun
```

```{block, type="info"}
Now we have;
* rain data for the summer months from 1862 to 2015 (`Summer_Rain`)
* sunshine data for the summer months from 1919 to 2020 (`Summer_Sun`)
Notice they have data from some of the same years, but also have data from years unique to each table
```


#### inner_join()

`inner_join()` returns all rows from both tables for which the values in column specified in the `"by = "` statement overlap. 

<center> <img src="images/inner_join1.png"> </center>

Here we merge `Summer_Sun` and `Summer_Rain` with `inner_join()` specifying we want to "join by" the variable `year`. Becuase the remaining variable has the same name in both tables, R needs to distiguish them from each other, for that we use the `suffix = ` arguement, which allows us to specify what suffix to add to each column of the resulting table. If we do not spcify this, R will add a `.x` and `.y` suffix for us to the x (left) and y (right) table variables respectively.

```{r}
inner <- inner_join(Summer_Sun, Summer_Rain, by="year", suffix = c("_sun", "_rain"))
inner
```

Using an inner join returns only 97 (1919 to 2015) rows of observations because these are the only years in `year` that are present in both the Sun (1919 to 2020) and the Rain (1862 to 2015) data tables. However, we are still merging both tibbles together, meaning that all columns from `Summer_Sun` and `Summer_Rain` are kept (in our case `sum`, with a suffix added to each to tell them appart). In this example, the years 1862 to 1918, are dropped becuase they are not present in the Sun data, and the years 2016 to 2020 are dropped becuase they are not present in the Rain data.

```{block, type="funfact"}
If you don't specify which variable to "join by", and omit the by statement, the R will joing by all columns in common... 

Try it for yourself in the `Console` and see what happens
```


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

How many rows (or observations) does `inner` have? `r fitb("97")` <br>
How many columns (or variables) does `inner` have? `r fitb("3")` <br>



#### left_join()

`left_join()` retains the complete first (left) table and adds values from the second (right) table that have matching values in the column specified in the `"by ="` statement. Rows in the left table with no match in the right table will have missing values (`NA`) in the new columns. 


<center> <img src="images/left_join1.png"> </center>

Let's try this `left_join()` function for our simple example of `Summer_Sun` and `Summer_Rain` in R.

```{r}
left <- left_join(Summer_Sun, Summer_Rain, by="year", suffix = c("_sun", "_rain"))
left
```

Here `Summer_Sun` is returned in full, and for every matching `year` in `Summer_Rain` the value is added. However, `Summer_Rain` does not have any value for the years 2016 to 2020, hence `NA` is added here to the column `sum_rain`.  

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

How many rows (or observations) does `left` have? `r fitb("102")` <br>
How many columns (or variables) does `left` have? `r fitb("3")` <br>




#### right_join()

`right_join()` retains the complete second (right) table and adds values from the first (left) table that have matching values in the column specified in the by statement. Rows in the right table with no match in the left table will have missing values (`NA`) in the new columns.

<center> <img src="images/right_join1.png"> </center>

However, code-wise, you would still enter x as the first, and y as the second argument within `right_join()`.

```{r}
right <- right_join(Summer_Sun, Summer_Rain, by="year", suffix = c("_sun", "_rain"))
right
```
Here `Summer_Rain` is returned in full, and for every matching `year` in `Summer_Sun` the value is added, for any row of `Summer_Rain` that does not have a mating value in `Summer_Sun`, `NA` is added. Notice the order of the rows, though!!! All the years of `Summer_Sun` come first before the extra rows from `Summer_Rain` are added at the bottom. That is due to the order of how they are entered into the `right_join()` function. The "left" data (first table) is still prioritised in terms of ordering observations!

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

How many rows (or observations) does `right` have? `r fitb("154")` <br>



#### full_join()

`full_join()` returns all rows and all columns from both dataframes. `NA` values fill unmatched rows. 

<center> <img src="images/full_join1.png"> </center>


```{r}
full <- full_join(Summer_Sun, Summer_Rain, by="year", suffix = c("_sun", "_rain"))
full
```

As you can see, all years from both tables are kept, and `NA` is used to fill the missing years (1862 to 1918 for `sum_sun`, and 2016 to 2020 for `sum_rain`). Again you can see the prioritization of the left (first) table in the arrangement of the years.


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

How many rows (or observations) does `full` have? `r fitb("159")` <br>


### Mutating Join Summary

| join function | Description  |
|:----------|:---------------------------|
| inner_join() | Includes all rows that are PRESENT IN BOTH the left and the right table  |
| left_join() | Includes all rows from the left table (first data entered) |
| left_join() | Includes all rows from the right table (second data entered) |
|	full_join() | Includes all rows from both left and right tables |


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: hsl(24, 100%, 50%);">Question Time</span>

```{block, type="task"}
**Your turn**

Join together `wos_seasonal_rain` and `wos_seasonal_sun` so that we keep all the rows from the `wos_seasonal_sun` table, add a useful suffix so you can differentiate between columns with the same name. Store the result in `Q10`.
```

`r hide("Solution")`
```{r}
#Jaimie's solution
Q10 <- left_join(wos_seasonal_sun, wos_seasonal_rain, by = "year", suffix = c("_sun", "_rain"))
#OR 
Q10 <- right_join(wos_seasonal_rain, wos_seasonal_sun, by = "year", suffix = c("_rain", "_sun"))

Q10
```
`r unhide()`


###	Binding Join Verbs

In contrast to mutating join verbs, binding join verbs simply combine tables without any need for matching. Dplyr provides `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` for combining tables by row and column respectively. When row binding, missing columns are replaced by `NA` values. When column binding, if the tables do not match by appropriate dimensions, an error will result. 


#### bind_rows()

`bind_rows()` is ideal when you have more entries of the same kind of data, i.e. new observations of the same variables. (For example; you have a new batch of participants answering the same questionnaire; or you have new air pollution data from a different geographic region... same variables - different observations)

Lets split some data

```{r}
Sun_Season_1 <- wos_seasonal_sun %>%
  filter(year >= 1970)

Sun_Season_2 <- wos_seasonal_sun %>%
  filter(year < 1970)
```

Now we have 2 indetical tables for seasonal sunshine in the west of Scotland, but for different sets of years. All the same variables, but totally different observations.

We can easily join these together with `bind_rows` to create a complete history.
```{r}
Bind_1 <- bind_rows(Sun_Season_1, Sun_Season_2)
Bind_1
```
`bind_rows()` takes the second table `Sun_Season_2` and puts it *directly underneath* the first table `Sun_Season_1`. 


What happens if we attempt to bind tables with different dimensions
```{r}
Bind_2 <- bind_rows(Sun_Season_1, inner)
Bind_2
```
Notice that the `bind_rows()` does not "care" if it duplicates rows, here we have repeat years. Also `bind_rows()` does not "care" that there are columns that do not match between the tables, here `NA` is added fill the missing space. 

#### bind_cols()

`bind_cols()` is similar to our mutating join verbs in that it creates a new table by joining columns (or variables) together. However, note that `bind_cols()` does not perform any kind of row-wise matching when joining tables.

```{r}
Bind_3 <- bind_cols(wos_monthly_sun, wos_seasonal_sun)
```
`bind_cols()`takes `wos_seasonal_sun` and puts it *right next* to `wos_monthly_sun`. Since the column name `year` is in both tables they get called `year..1` and `year...15` after their respective column number to differentiate them.



What happens if we attempt to bind tables with different dimensions
```{r, error=TRUE}
Bind_4 <- bind_cols(Summer_Sun, Summer_Rain)
```
You simply get an error



```{block, type="funfact"}
By the way, you can merge as many data objects as you like with the binding functions, whereas in the join functions, you are limited to two. However, you could use a pipe to combine the merged dataframe with a third.

example 1: bind_rows(data1, data2, data3) <br>
example 2: full_join(data1, data2) %>% full_join(data3)

Just to further clarify the differences between `bind_cols()` and the mutating joing verbs, lets look at how they would deal with the same challenge

First lets create a new table for winter sun data, but lets arrange it by "win", so that rather than being in order of `year`, it is in order of most sunshine. This will have the same dimensions as the Summer_Sun table but a totally different order

```{r}
Winter_Sun <- wos_seasonal_sun %>% 
  select(year, win) %>%
  arrange(desc(win))
Winter_Sun
```

Now lets try joining Winter_Sun and Summer_Sun using the two different methods
```{r}
Comparison_1 <- bind_cols(Summer_Sun, Winter_Sun)
Comparison_2 <- left_join(Summer_Sun, Winter_Sun, "year")

Comparison_1
Comparison_2
```


```{block, type="info"}
Using bind_cols() simply "copy and pasted" the two tables together, the fact that the rows were in different orders did not matter. On the other hand, using left_join() meant that R compared the content of "year" and matched them up, ignoring the fact that Winter_Sun was in a different arrangement.
```
